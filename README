Based on my ramblings at http://gerdr.github.com/on-parrot/rethinking-m0.html

This is actually the 2nd prototype - I already took a shot at it last year
(Sep-Dec 2011), but lost interest when the codebase became too bothersome.

This version is a bit more tractable as I figured out how to abuse gcc via
computed gotos and inline assembly to produce identical code to the formerly
Perl-generated LLVM IR.
